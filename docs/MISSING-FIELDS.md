# GL Allocations — Engie columns with no UBM source

The client's Visible Columns list for GL Allocations is 38 entries: the 9 the report
loads plus 29 more offered in the picker. **26 are mapped and offered today.**

Nothing below is guessed at. Each was checked against the schema of every table the
report can reach, read on 2026-08-05.

## Mapped in this pass

Eight columns that previously had no source were found:

| Engie Column | UBM Source | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vendor Address 1 | `(remittance_address).line_1` | The vendor address is a **composite type** on `providers_vendors` / `customers_providers_vendors`, not flat columns — which is why searching the schema by column name found nothing. Fields: `line_1`…`line_4`, `city`, `state`, `post_code`, `country`. |
| Vendor Address 2 | `(remittance_address).line_2` | Lines 3 and 4 exist and can be added if a vendor uses them. |
| Vendor City | `(remittance_address).city` | |
| Vendor State/Province | `(remittance_address).state` | |
| Vendor Postal Code | `(remittance_address).post_code` | |
| Vendor Country | `(remittance_address).country` | |
| Meter # | `virtual_accounts.meter_serial` | Account grain, so no row multiplication. |
| Clean Account # | *derived* | UBM stores no clean account number. Derived from Account # by removing punctuation — a rule, not a mapping. Say so if the client asks where it comes from. |

All six vendor address fields follow the same priority the vendor name uses: the
customer's own vendor record first, then the global one.

Two more stopped being blank placeholders in the same read:

| Engie Column | UBM Source | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account Creation Date | `virtual_accounts.created_at` | When UBM created the account record — matches the timestamp in Engie's example, down to the minute. `account_opened` is the alternative if the client means the utility's own opening date. |
| Account Status Date | `COALESCE(virtual_accounts_status.account_closed, .account_opened)` | There is no single status-date column. The date the current status took effect is the closing date where there is one, the opening date otherwise. |

## Not in the database

These twelve are absent, not unmapped. They are left out of the picker rather than
shown as permanently empty columns:

| Engie Column | Closest thing in UBM | What we need |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location Address 2 | `locations.address` and `location_detail.location_address` are both single lines. No second line on either. | Whether Engie ever populates a second line for this customer. If so, UBM needs somewhere to put it. |
| Misc Information | Nothing by that name. `locations.payload` is free-form and may carry it. | What Engie's Misc Information holds, then whether `payload` holds the same thing. |
| Audit Only | No audit flag on `virtual_accounts`. | Which system holds the audit-only flag. |
| Account Address 1 / Address 2 / City / State-Province / Postal Code | `virtual_accounts` has no address columns at all. `analytics_billing_line_items.service_address` exists, but it is bill-line grain — joining it would multiply report rows — and it is the service address, not the account's mailing address. | Whether the account address *is* the service address. If it is, this is buildable the way Late Charges is: aggregated so it can't multiply rows. |
| Service Description / Service Alias / Service Status / Service Point Location | No services table found in the tables read so far. `analytics_billing_line_items.description` is a line-item description, not a service one. | **Still pending** — the filtered table list returned 33 rows and only the first 11 were readable. A services table may yet exist. |

## Also found

`location_detail` carries `location_division`, `location_top_group`,
`location_second_group` and `location_third_group`. The catalog says UBM has no
hierarchy fields, on advice from 2026-06-17; that is wrong. No report in the workbook
asks for them, so they are not added — but they are there when one does.
